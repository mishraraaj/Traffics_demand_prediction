Problem Statement:- Exploring 14 different towns to the North-West, and using the data provided by bus ticket sales from Mobiticket, predicting the number of tickets that will be sold for buses .
### Applied various model out of which XGBOOST performed the best wth Test score of 0.84211254
# Conclusion
This resulting model can be used by Mobiticket and bus operators to anticipate for the tickets for certain rides. We have compared the performance of six different regression models. XGBoost regression model performed the best among them including the ensemble model proposed with the lowest error rate. We pre-processed data to apply regression models for forecasting the speed of vehicles and distance between the source and destination.
